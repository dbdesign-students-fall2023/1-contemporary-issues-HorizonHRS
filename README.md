# About the responsibilities and functions of CNKI
In this document, I discuss two articles about About the responsibilities and functions of CNKI. I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1：[China’s Controversial Academic Database Fined $6.8 Million for Illegal Data Collection](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1013683)
In recent news, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the country's largest academic research database, has received a substantial fine of 50 million yuan (approximately $6.8 million) from China's Cyberspace Administration. This fine follows a yearlong investigation that revealed CNKI's mishandling of personal information. The database was found to have illegally collected users' personal data through 14 mobile applications, including popular apps like CNKI and CNKI Reading. These apps failed to inform users about how their personal information would be collected and used and did not promptly delete user accounts upon request.

CNKI, also known as Zhiwang in China, has faced controversy in recent years due to its monopolistic practices, including disputes over the rights to academic work. Last year, China's market regulator imposed a significant fine of 1.75 billion yuan on CNKI for abusing its market dominance. Chen Jihong, a cybersecurity and data protection expert at Zhong Lun Law Firm, noted that the recent fine is the maximum penalty allowed under China's Personal Information Protection Law.

Additionally, CNKI holds a substantial amount of personal information and sensitive data related to key sectors like national defense, telecommunications, and transportation. This prompted the Cyberspace Administration to initiate a cybersecurity review in June 2022. It's worth noting that the results of this cybersecurity review may not be publicly disclosed due to national security concerns. This incident underscores the growing importance of data privacy and cybersecurity regulations in China's digital landscape.

## Article 2：[China launches cybersecurity review into online academic database to 'prevent data security risks, safeguard natl security'](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202206/1268948.shtml)
The recent news about the cybersecurity review of China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the country's largest academic research database, is closely related to the previous article discussing a fine imposed on CNKI for mishandling personal information. In this new development, China has launched a cybersecurity review of CNKI, highlighting the government's increased scrutiny of data-related issues.

The cybersecurity review aims to prevent national data security risks and protect national security and public interest, according to officials. CNKI is reported to hold a vast amount of personal information and important data in key industries such as national defense, telecommunications, transport, natural resources, health, and finance, raising concerns about data privacy and security. This review comes on the heels of an antitrust investigation launched by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) into CNKI, indicating a broader regulatory effort to address issues related to data and market dominance.

The interconnectedness of these developments shows that China is taking a comprehensive approach to address data-related concerns, both in terms of personal data protection and market competition. It underscores the significance of data governance and cybersecurity in the country's digital landscape, particularly for entities like CNKI that play a crucial role in academic research and data storage.
